# Power Plant Electricity Output

This Python notebook is the product of a graduate course in Applied Machine Learning. The project consists of implementing various Machine Learning models to predict the electric output of a Combine Cycle Power Plant bases on environmental conditions, ssuch as ambient temperature, pressure and relative humidty.

The models were trained across various test-train splits to test their robustness in predicting out-of-sample data and understand trade-offs associated with training time.

The Machine Learning models in this project are:
* Support Vector Machine
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Gaussian process Regression
* Random Forrest Regression
* Ridge Linear Regression
* Lasso Linear Regression
* Elastic-Net Linear Regression
* Deep Neural Network
